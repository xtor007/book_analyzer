Soren, a Barn Owl, or a Tyto Alba, lived in a nest in a hollow of a fir tree with his parents Noctus and Marella and siblings Kludd and Eglantine, who is newly hatched, in a forest kingdom called Tyto. Soren falls out of the nest and onto the bottom of the forest, a dangerous place for an owlet, an easy prey for raccoons. It is later revealed that Soren was pushed by Kludd, who performed the deed (or Tupsi) to become a member of the Pure Ones, an evil organisation which believes Tyto owls to be pure and should be positioned in a place of ascendancy. When Soren cries out for help, but cannot obtain it from his parents as they are absent from the tree hollow and are on a long hunt for food. Mrs. Plithiver, their blind nest-maid, answers the call and asks for Kludd to help Soren. Kludd, refusing to help his brother with the apparent reason that it wasn't his place to teach flying. Mrs. Plithiver, or Mrs. P for short, tries to go to another nest-maid for help is not allowed to access the exit by an ominous Kludd. Soren is then found and snatched by a patrol of the evil owls from the St. Aegolius Academy for Orphaned Owls, or St. Aggie's. Soren and other snatched owlets are enslaved into tasks such as sorting eggs and pellets, for reasons they do not quite understand. Owls at St. Aggie's are "moon blinked", a brainwashing technique caused by sleeping under the full moon and also marching under the light of the full moon and endlessly repeating their true names to forget them so as to lose a sense of self and will. Soren befriends a young elf owl named Gylfie (from the desert kingdom of Kuneer), who tells him about moon- blinking. Soren finds a way to evade moon- blinking, by staying awake during the full shine. Together, under the guise of being moon-blinked, they plot both to discover as much as possible about the true purpose behind St. Aggie's and to escape. Gylfie suspects that a spotted owl named Hortense is not moon blinked. Soren and Gylfie then befriend her, and find out that Hortense is sneaking out eggs stolen by the owls of St. Aggie's and is returning them back to their parents with the help of two eagles, Zan and Streak. Hortense's intention is then discovered by the owls of St. Aggie's, and Hortense is then killed. Soren and Gylfie also find a partly moon-blinked boreal owl named Grimble and plan to escape with Grimble teaching them how to fly. Grimble is murdered the night Soren and Gylfie escape by St. Aggie's leader Skench the great horned owl and her lieutenant Spoorn the western screech owl. After escaping, they then meet Twilight, an orphan great gray owl who learned his survival instincts from the "Orphan School of Tough Learning", Digger, a burrowing owl, who lost his family to the St. Aggie's marauders and is extremely sensitive and philosophical, and the old Mrs. Plithiver, Soren's former nest-maid western blind snake. With the help of Hortense's two bald eagle friends Streak and Zan, they killed two of St. Aggie's patrols, the cousins Jatt and Jutt the long-eared owls, and then the newly-formed band decide to head to the Guardians of Ga'hoole and inform them of the monstrosity of St. Aggie's.
